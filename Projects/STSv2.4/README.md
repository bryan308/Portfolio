# Students Transcripts System (STS) v2.4

    STS (Students Transcripts System) is a web-based application designed to assist school registrars in managing and generating students transcripts. The current version of STS is considered a work in progress and may contain gaps and limitations. Continuous development and improvements are necessary to enhance functionality and address identified issues. As the STS project was developed within a limited timeframe of one month, developers are admitted on the STS's limitations especially in security. The main objective of this Project is to generate/export an excel file in (.xlsx) format since the system is isolated and not for publication on it's first deployment.
